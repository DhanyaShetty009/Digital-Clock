## **Digital Clock**
This project is a digital clock that not only displays the current time but also provides two additional features:

A distinct number representation of the time.The individual sum of each number in the time.The format of the clock is as follows:

**HH:MM | Distinct Number | Sum of Digits**

## **Features**
**Time Display:** The current time is displayed in hours and minutes (HH:MM).

**Distinct Number:** Extracted unique digits from the time.

**Sum of Digits:** Sum of all individual digits in the time.

Technologies Used:

HTML: For structuring the content.

CSS: For styling and visual enhancements.

JavaScript: For functionality and time calculations.


## **How It Works**

The clock updates in real time to show the current hour and minute.

JavaScript extracts the distinct digits from the time (e.g., "12:34" â†’ "1, 2, 3, 4").

It calculates the sum of these digits.
